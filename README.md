ClasCol
============

Collaborative sorting of cards in a table. Runs with node.js and a couple provided libs.

The instantiation of a sorting is provided by a json file and a set of images.

Coding conventions and tags
------------------------
Many functionnalities will not be developped in the first versions. When modifications are necessary for a given anticipated functionnality, a tag will be added in the code.
Existing tags are the following:
* #3d â†’ The current version only works with 2 categories associated to each card (table representation, this tags indicates where to change stuff to expand the number of categories).

Order in which the javascript files call each other
---------------------------------------------------
* home calls class / jquery and then main
* main calls ??
* card calls position
